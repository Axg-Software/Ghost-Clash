# Co-op game in Raylib
This is a game im going to be working on for a little bit.
My goal for this game is to be a fun co-op where you can get a friend and 1v1 each other.
You would fight by shooting each other, and you can block by using a key that would make a temp wall in front of you!
Which would get deleted 5 - 10 sec later.
